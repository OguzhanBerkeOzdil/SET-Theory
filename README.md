# Set Operations Python Script

This repository contains a Python script for performing various set operations, along with a simple command-line interface for interacting with sets. You can define sets, perform operations on them, and save the state of sets to a file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/OguzhanBerkeOzdil/SET-Theory.git


   ### Usage

1. Define your sets in the main.py script by following the provided format:
   
   set1 = {1, 2, 3}
   set2 = {1, 2, 41}
   set3 = {1, 2, 42525}
   
2. Run the script:
   
   python main.py

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform set operations:
 * For one-element operations, type the set name and operation (e.g., set1 print, set2 add).
 * For two-element operations, type the set names and operation (e.g., set1 set2 equal, set1 set2 union).
 " You can also save the state of sets to a file named sets.txt by choosing option 3. "
