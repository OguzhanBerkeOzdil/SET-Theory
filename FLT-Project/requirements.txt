# No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library

# Python version compatibility: 3.7+
# The application uses:
# - typing (for type hints)
# - datetime (for timestamps)
# - json (for future data serialization features)
# - os (for system operations)
# - time (for UI delays)

# Optional: For future enhancements
# matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For set visualization
# networkx>=2.6.0    # For advanced mathematical operations
# numpy>=1.21.0      # For numerical computations
